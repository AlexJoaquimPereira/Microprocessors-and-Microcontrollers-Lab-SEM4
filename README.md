# Microprocessors-and-Microcontrollers-Lab-SEM4
My Microprocessors and Microcontrollers Laboratory course (CE470)

## Experiment 1: Study Experiment
	a. Case study of history and evolution of microprocessors
 	b. Case study and comparisn of different levels of programming languages
  	c. Comparison of Intel i3, i5, i7 processors

## Experiment 2: Assembly level language programming using NASM
	a. Write an ALP to display "Hello, World!"
 	b. Write an ALP to display Hello World along with your name
  	c. Write an ALP to displau 9 stars using times directive
   	d. Write an ALP to display two strings using EQU directive
	e. Write an ALP to replace a work in a given string using dword
 	f. Write an ALP that reads a number from keyboard and displays the number
  	g. Write an ALP to print your name by taking input from the user
   	h. Write an ALP to take two numbers as input using EQU and display

## Experiment 3: Mathematical Operations of Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division.
	a. Write an assembly language program to enter two numbers and display their sum on screen using EQU directive.
	b. Write an assembly language program to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two entered numbers.
	c. Write an assembly language program to find area and perimeter of rectangle and triangle.
	d. Write an assembly language program to display sum of 3 entered numbers.
	e. Write an assembly language program that inputs a number and display the number and the next 4 numbers using increment operation.
	f. Write an assembly language program to calculate the area of the circle.
	g. Write an assembly language program to display all odd numbers from 0 to 9.
	h. Write an assembly language program to find the multiples of 3 from 0 to 9.

## Experiment 4: JUMP AND COMPARISON OPERATIONS
	**AIM**: To understand the working of Jump and Comparison operations and to use these operations in writing efficient assembly language programs.
	a. Write an assembly language program to find the largest of two numbers.
	b. Write an assembly language program to find the largest of three numbers.
	c. Write an assembly language program to find the smallest of three numbers.
	d. Write an assembly language program to check if the number is greater than 5 or lesser than 5.
	e. Write an assembly language program to check whether the entered number is even or odd.
	f. Write an assembly language program that compares two strings and checks if they are same string.
